# Kimi Cancel

Forward this request to the local kimi-code companion runtime by shell. Do not use MCP for this skill.

## Invocation

- Resolve the plugin root: prefer `$PLUGIN_ROOT` if the host sets it; otherwise use the directory that CONTAINS the `skills/` directory (i.e. two levels up from this `SKILL.md`).
- Sanity check: `<plugin-root>/scripts/companion.sh` must exist — it is the bundled entrypoint that resolves Node and runs the compiled runtime from `<plugin-root>/dist/`.
- Launch the shell command from the user's current workspace directory so `scripts/companion.sh` captures the intended workspace cwd.
- Run: `PLUGIN_ROOT="<plugin-root>" "<plugin-root>/scripts/companion.sh" cancel <args>`
- If the plugin host provides `PLUGIN_DATA` instead of `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, the shell wrapper exports the Claude-compatible alias for the runtime. If neither is set, the wrapper uses a Codex data directory under `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/data/kimi-marketplace-kimi`, `~/.codex/plugins/data/kimi-marketplace-kimi`, or `/tmp/kimi-plugin-cc-codex-data/kimi-marketplace-kimi` in a fully sanitized environment.

## Arguments

Pass through: `[<job-id>]`

## Handling

- Pass the requested job id when supplied; otherwise let the companion choose the latest active job for this repository.
- Return companion stdout verbatim so the user sees the cancellation state.
